### User Guide

#### 1.0 Introduction
This User Guide will provide information on how to navigate the website.  This section will go into detail on creating an account, logging in, and the three main features of our site: the Explore Page, the VizBuilder page, and the StoryBuilder page.  For more information and guidance on how to use the site, please see the 'Demo' section of the site.

#### 2.0 User Accounts
The Reach site can be used without creating an account; however to save any maps, graphs, or stories a user account must be created to persist that data.

WARNING: Please do not use passwords that you would use on other sites.  We are still working on encryption and the overall security of our site.

##### 2.1 Creating an Account
1. To create an account, click the ‘Login’ button in the upper right hand corner and then navigate to 'Create Account' in the upper right hand corner.  
2. There are three options to create an account: through Facebook, Google, or by creating a Reach account by entering your name, email, and password.  
3. Once your account is created, you will be automatically logged in, which is indicated by the user icon appearing in the upper right hand corner.
##### 2.2 Logging in

#### 3.0 Explore Page
The Explore page is a way for users to view stories built by others using the StoryBuilder (see section 5.0).  These stories can be shared to social media or saved to your personal device.  The search bar at the top of the page will be used to search for relevant stories.  This page is still under construction and is not yet fully functional.
